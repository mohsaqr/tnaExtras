\usage{
compute_sequence_indices(
  data,
  group_col = NULL,
  all_possible_states = NULL,
  favorable_states = NULL,
  min_length = 1,
  return_group_summary = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with sequences in wide format (columns are time points) OR a group_tna object}

\item{group_col}{Column name or index containing group information (optional).
Ignored if data is a group_tna object.}

\item{all_possible_states}{Vector of all possible states (optional, will be inferred if not provided)}

\item{favorable_states}{Vector of states considered "favorable" for system analysis (optional)}

\item{min_length}{Minimum sequence length to include (default: 1)}

\item{return_group_summary}{Whether to return group-level summaries (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
Data frame with sequence indices, or list with individual and group summaries
}
\description{
Calculates a wide range of sequence-level statistics and indices that
characterize the structure, dynamics, and complexity of individual sequences
with emphasis on system stability, Markov chain properties, and state favorability.
Supports both data.frame input and group_tna objects from the tna package.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# With data.frame
data <- read.csv("sequence_data.csv")
# Define favorable states for your system
favorable_states <- c("consensus", "cohesion", "synthesis", "coregulate")
indices <- compute_sequence_indices(data, group_col = "Group", favorable_states = favorable_states)

# With group_tna object
# group_tna_obj <- tna::create_group_tna(...)
# indices <- compute_sequence_indices(group_tna_obj, favorable_states = favorable_states)
}
