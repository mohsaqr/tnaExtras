\title{Comprehensive Pattern Analysis (Auto-detects 2 or Multiple Groups)}
\usage{
analyze_patterns(
  data,
  group_col = "Group",
  min_length = 2,
  max_length = 5,
  min_frequency = 2,
  measures = "auto",
  statistical = FALSE,
  correction = "bonferroni"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with sequences in wide format OR a group_tna object}

\item{group_col}{Column name or index containing group information (default: "Group").
Ignored if data is a group_tna object.}

\item{min_length}{Minimum pattern length to analyze (default: 2)}

\item{max_length}{Maximum pattern length to analyze (default: 5)}

\item{min_frequency}{Minimum frequency required to include a pattern (default: 2).
If too high, may result in "No patterns meet threshold" error. Try reducing if this occurs.}

\item{measures}{Character vector of measures to compute (default: auto-selected based on group count)}

\item{statistical}{Whether to include statistical testing for 2-group analysis (default: FALSE)}

\item{correction}{Multiple comparison correction method (default: "bonferroni").
Supports all R p.adjust methods: "holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none"}
}
\value{
List containing analysis results (structure depends on number of groups detected)
}
\description{
Automatically detects the number of groups and performs appropriate pattern analysis.
For 2 groups: provides detailed statistical measures including lift, confidence, effect sizes.
For 3+ groups: provides multi-group support-based analysis with discrimination measures.
Supports both data.frame input and group_tna objects from the tna package.
