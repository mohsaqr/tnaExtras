\title{Student Engagement Sequences Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 1000 rows and 26 columns:
\describe{
\item{Group}{Factor with 3 levels: "Low", "Moderate", "Engaged" - represents the student's overall engagement group}
\item{T1-T25}{Character variables representing engagement level at each time point:
\itemize{
\item "Active" - Student is actively engaged
\item "Average" - Student shows moderate engagement
\item "Disengaged" - Student is not engaged
}
}
}
}
\source{
Simulated student engagement data for educational research and
demonstration of temporal pattern analysis techniques.
}
\usage{
engagement_data
}
\description{
A dataset containing sequential engagement patterns of 1000 students across 25 time points.
Students are classified into three engagement groups based on their overall engagement levels.
This dataset is ideal for demonstrating transition network analysis, sequential pattern mining,
and association rule learning with temporal educational data.
}
\details{
This dataset represents student engagement patterns collected over 25 consecutive time points.
Each row represents one student's engagement trajectory, and each time point (T1-T25)
captures their engagement state at that moment.

\strong{Group Distribution:}
\itemize{
\item Low: 260 students (26.0\%)
\item Moderate: 225 students (22.5\%)
\item Engaged: 515 students (51.5\%)
}

\strong{Engagement States:}
\itemize{
\item Active: High engagement, active participation
\item Average: Moderate engagement level
\item Disengaged: Low engagement, passive or absent
}

\strong{Potential Analyses:}
\itemize{
\item Sequential pattern analysis with \code{analyze_patterns()}
\item Multi-group comparison with \code{compare_sequences_multi()}
\item Association rule mining with \code{apriori_rules()} and \code{fp_growth_rules()}
\item Sequence complexity analysis with \code{compute_sequence_indices()}
\item Transition network analysis and temporal pattern detection
}
