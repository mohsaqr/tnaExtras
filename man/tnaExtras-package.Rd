\title{tnaExtras: Temporal Network Analysis and Sequential Pattern Detection Extras}
\description{
A comprehensive toolkit for analyzing temporal patterns in sequential data. Provides functions for sequence comparison, pattern analysis, and computation of sequence-level indices with focus on complexity systems, Markov chain dynamics, and temporal network analysis. Supports multi-group analysis (3+ groups) in addition to traditional two-group comparisons. NEW in v0.3.0: Association Rule Learning with Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms for discovering frequent patterns and rules in transaction data. NEW: Advanced sequence clustering with multiple distance methods (Euclidean, Hamming, LCS, transition analysis, optimal matching, stringdist integration) and clustering algorithms (PAM, hierarchical methods). Features Mixture Markov Model clustering with EM algorithm. Includes statistical testing capabilities, comprehensive visualization support, and measures for system stability and favorability analysis. All algorithms implemented with minimal external dependencies. Package includes two comprehensive educational datasets: student engagement sequences (1000 students × 25 time points) and student self-regulation sequences across academic disciplines (2000 students × 26 time points) for demonstration and educational purposes.
