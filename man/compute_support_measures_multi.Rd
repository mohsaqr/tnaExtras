\usage{
compute_support_measures_multi(patterns, group_sequences, group_names)

\arguments{
\item{patterns}{Character vector of patterns to analyze}

\item{group_sequences}{List of character vectors, one for each group}

\item{group_names}{Character vector of group names}
}
\value{
Data frame with support measures
}
\description{
Support measures how frequently a pattern appears in each group.
Support is defined as the proportion of sequences containing the pattern.
