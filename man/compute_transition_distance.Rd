\title{Compute Advanced Transition Distance for Sequences}
\usage{
compute_transition_distance(
  data,
  first_order_weight = 0.3,
  second_order_weight = 0.2,
  time_weighted_weight = 0.2,
  complexity_weight = 0.15,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or matrix where rows are sequences and columns are time points}

\item{first_order_weight}{Weight for basic state transitions (default: 0.3)}

\item{second_order_weight}{Weight for higher-order patterns (default: 0.2)}

\item{time_weighted_weight}{Weight for temporal emphasis (default: 0.2)}

\item{complexity_weight}{Weight for pattern diversity (default: 0.15)}

\item{persistence_weight}{Weight for state stability (default: 0.15)}
}
\value{
A distance object of class 'dist'
}
\description{
Computes distance based on comprehensive Markov transition analysis including
higher-order patterns, time-weighted transitions, and pattern complexity.
