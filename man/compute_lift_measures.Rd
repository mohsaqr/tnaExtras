\usage{
compute_lift_measures(
  patterns,
  group_A_seqs,
  group_B_seqs,
  group_names = c("A", "B")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{patterns}{Character vector of patterns to analyze}

\item{group_A_seqs}{Character vector of sequences for group A}

\item{group_B_seqs}{Character vector of sequences for group B}

\item{group_names}{Character vector of actual group names (default: c("A", "B"))}
}
\value{
Data frame with lift measures
}
\description{
Lift measures how much more likely a pattern is in one group versus the other
compared to what would be expected by chance.
