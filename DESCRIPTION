Description: A comprehensive toolkit for analyzing temporal patterns in sequential data.
    Provides functions for sequence comparison, pattern analysis, and computation
    of sequence-level indices with focus on complexity systems, Markov chain dynamics,
    and temporal network analysis. Now supports multi-group analysis (3+ groups) in 
    addition to traditional two-group comparisons. Includes statistical testing 
    capabilities, visualization support, and measures for system stability and 
    favorability analysis.
