Description: A comprehensive toolkit for analyzing temporal patterns in sequential data.
    Provides functions for sequence comparison, pattern analysis, and computation
    of sequence-level indices with focus on complexity systems, Markov chain dynamics,
    and temporal network analysis. Supports multi-group analysis (3+ groups) in 
    addition to traditional two-group comparisons. NEW in v0.3.0: Association Rule 
    Learning with Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms for discovering frequent patterns 
    and rules in transaction data. Includes statistical testing capabilities, 
    comprehensive visualization support, and measures for system stability and 
    favorability analysis. All algorithms implemented with no external dependencies.
