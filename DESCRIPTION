Description: A comprehensive toolkit for analyzing temporal patterns in sequential data.
    Provides functions for sequence comparison, pattern analysis, and computation
    of sequence-level indices with focus on complexity systems, Markov chain dynamics,
    and temporal network analysis. Supports multi-group analysis (3+ groups) in 
    addition to traditional two-group comparisons. NEW in v0.3.0: Association Rule 
    Learning with Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms for discovering frequent patterns 
    and rules in transaction data. NEW: Advanced sequence clustering with multiple 
    distance methods (Euclidean, Hamming, LCS, transition analysis, optimal matching, 
    stringdist integration) and clustering algorithms (PAM, hierarchical methods). 
    Features Mixture Markov Model clustering with EM algorithm. Includes statistical 
    testing capabilities, comprehensive visualization support, and measures for 
    system stability and favorability analysis. All algorithms implemented with 
    minimal external dependencies. Package includes two comprehensive educational 
    datasets: student engagement sequences (1000 students × 25 time points) and 
    student self-regulation sequences across academic disciplines (2000 students × 26 
    time points) for demonstration and educational purposes.
