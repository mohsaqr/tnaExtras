Description: A comprehensive toolkit for analyzing temporal patterns in sequential data.
    Provides functions for sequence comparison, pattern analysis, and computation
    of sequence-level indices with focus on complexity systems, Markov chain dynamics,
    and temporal network analysis. Includes statistical testing capabilities,
    visualization support, and measures for system stability and favorability analysis.
